some_node:
  _doc_: |
    This node is documented with a multiline string.

    Expected rendering for code blocks and stuff:

    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```
  subnode:
    _doc_: "Some subnode"
    subsubnode:
      _doc_: |
        Another node with structured documentation.

        ```bash
        echo "Nice!"
        ```

        We expect lists to also render nicely:

          - As if you were
          - writing a basic
          - Markdown document
